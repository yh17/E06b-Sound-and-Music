# E06b-Sound-and-Music

This is an opportunity for you to create sound effects and music and make them a part of your games going forward. Fork and Clone this repository to your computer.

First, you will need to download and install audio recording software. I recommend using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/), it is free and it should allow you to quickly accomplish the requirements of this exercise.

You will need to record three sound effects. [This tutorial](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_your_first_recording.html) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshLRl3GWqE) may help you get started. The sound effects should be about a second long, and they don't have to be complicated. Any reasonable, non-rude sound will do. Export each of the sound effects as .wav files. Then copy them into the Assets folder in this repository.

Next, you will need to download and install music composition software. This class of software is a little more complicated, but [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) is also free and (relatively) easy to use.

You will need to record a piece of music. That may seem daunting at first, but the only requirement is to create a piece of music with at least eight notes. [This basic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjlmycja-0I) or [this series](https://musescore.org/en/tutorials) may help you get started. When you have some notes on the score, you can play them using the play button at the top of the window. When you are happy, export your music as an Ogg Vorbis Audio file. Save the file in the Assets folder.

Import and open the project in Godot. You will see four AudioStreamPlayer nodes, three labeled as Sound and one labeled as Music. Add your three sound effects to the Sound nodes and the music file to the Music node (in the Inspector palettte). Run the program; you should hear the sounds play one at a time, followed by the music.

As always, update the LICENSE and README.md.

When you are done, commit and push your changes to GitHub. Then submit the URL of your repository on Canvas.
